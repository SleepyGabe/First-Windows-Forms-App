# First-Windows-Forms-App
The first app with a UI that I made using visual studio [School-Activities]

The other use I had for visual studio aside from making console apps. My first app that had an actual UI. No Logic involved in this one just yet. This activity was just used to test whether or not we've properly learned how to create forms apps using visual studio
